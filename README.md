### What is this repository for?

This repository implements and compares two versions of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, used for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights. The two versions include:

Recursive Version: Implements the Floyd-Warshall algorithm recursively.
Iterative Version: Implements the classic iterative approach of Floyd-Warshall.

### How do I get set up?

git clone https://github.com/Exp1ry/floyd-warshall-iterative-vs-recursive.git
cd src

### Running the scripts

Run the recursive script: python3 recursion/recursive_floyd.py

Run the iterative script: python3 iterative/iterative_floyd.py

Run tests: python3 -m unittest tests/unittests.py

### Requirements
